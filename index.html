            <h3>Here's a little of Bangabandhu's life:</h3>
            <p>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, shortened as Sheikh Mujib or Mujib, was a Bangladeshi politician 
                and statesman. He is called the "Father of the Nation" in Bangladesh. He served as the 
                first President of Bangladesh and later as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh from 17 April 
                1971 until his assassination on 15 August 1975. Mujib became the Prime Minister of Bangladesh 
                under a parliamentary system adopted by the new country. He charged the provisional parliament 
                to write a new constitution proclaiming the four fundamental principles of "nationalism, secularism, 
                democracy, and socialism", which reflect his political views collectively known as Mujibism.
                 The Awami League won a huge mandate in the country's first general election in 1973. However,
                  Mujib faced challenges of rampant unemployment, poverty and corruption, as well as the Bangladesh
                   famine of 1974. The government was criticized for denying constitutional recognition to 
                   indigenous minorities and human rights violations by its security forces, notably the 
                   National Defence Force or Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini paramilitary. Amid rising political agitation, 
                   Mujib initiated one party socialist rule in January 1975. Six months later, he and most of his 
                   family were assassinated by renegade army officers during a coup. A martial law government was 
                   subsequently established. In a 2004 BBC poll, Mujib was voted the Greatest Bengali of all
                    time.After the Partition of India, Mujib chose to stay in the newly created Pakistan. On his 
                    return to what became known as East Pakistan, he enrolled in the University of Dhaka to study
                     law and founded the East Pakistan Muslim Students' League. He became one of the most prominent
                      student political leaders in the province. During these years, Mujib developed an affinity for
                       socialism as the solution to mass poverty, unemployment, and poor living conditions.

                         and in courage, this man is the Himalayas. I have thus had the experience
                          of witnessing the Himalayas.”</em><br>
